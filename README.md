# Project Euler Solutions (Python)

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

The main goal of this project is to practice problem-solving, learn new algorithms, and improve my programming skills using **Python**.

## Repository Structure

I've organized my solutions by problem number. Each problem's solution is in its own Python file, following the naming convention `euler_p#.py` where `#` is the problem number.

- `euler_p1.py`
- `euler_p2.py`
- `euler_p3.py`

## My Progress

You can track my progress by seeing which problems have a solution file in the repository. I'll add new solutions as I solve more problems.
